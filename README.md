we developed and deploy a web application that allows users to predict the likelihood of three different diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The application will be built using the Streamlit framework for creating interactive data science applications.

3 major diseases:

1: Diabetes
 2: Heart disease
 3: Parkinson


ALGORITHM USED

1 : Svm stands for support vector machine, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.


 In SVM, the algorithm attempts to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space. The hyperplane is defined by a subset of training samples called support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary.



For classification, SVM can handle both binary and multi-class problems. It uses different kernels (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function) to transform the input features into a higher-dimensional space,
